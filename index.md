 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript-based server runtime
 - [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for Node
 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - JavaScript front-end library
 - [DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/documentdb/) - Managed, persistent NoSQL data storage in the cloud
